# Emi's Collection of Fixes for Nox

This is a collection of fixes for various bugs in the beautiful Nox theme for
Discord (see the parent repo).  I'm not the author of these fixes, although I
ported them repositories source code.  For the actual authors, please see the
name included on the commit.

If you're interested in using these hotfixes, you can download the altered
[Nox.theme.css][] from **this branch** of this repository.  Note that this will
prevent you from receiving automatic updates, and you'll be personally
responsible for switching back once the fixes are added to the upstream.
